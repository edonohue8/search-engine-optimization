Homepage from Horiseon for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to Help Increase Your Visibility

  This project required making this webpage more accessible.  In order to meet accessibility standards, I cleaned up both the 'index.html' and 'style.css' files.  This would help populate search engine results.  I also created comments on the code side to help organize each section.

  My first step consisted of changing any current tags to semantic HTML elements.  This would help describe their meaning in a human and machine-readable fashion.  For example, I removed all the <div> tags and replaced them with elements that help describe the purpose of the content that is inside them.  Next, I made sure the HTML elements followed a logical structure, which also involved making sure semantic HTML elements were used.  This helped organize the arrangement of the code on both the 'index.html' and 'style.css' files.  Next, I created alt attributes for each image in order to aid the search engine results to pick up information.  I described what is happening in each image.  After that, I made sure the heading attributes were in sequential order.  Lastly, I gave the webpage a descriptive title.
